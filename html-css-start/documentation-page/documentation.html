	<p>It is interesting to know the great wonders of the human mind.
	So you have spent years studying and training to be a professional
	in one particular field of your choosing. Now you have graduated
	and you have been introduced into the labour market where you will
	toil and toil for at least one decade before retiring to the sumber
	anticipation of death.<br>
	Life doesn't have to be this way. You are on top of the ecosystem's
	food chain for a reason. You mind has the capacity to learn and be a
	professional at multiple fields. So you can be a:
	<ul>
	<li>Doctor and a Lawyer.</li>
	<li>Architect and a Programmer</li>
	<li>Musician and a Politician</li>
	<li>Footballer and a Photographer</li>
	</ul>
	Basically the choice is yours. You can either choose to make your life
	interesting by learning new things and be a professional in multiple
	fields, or you can just follow the majority that live life in the direction
	of the wind.<br> Regarding my admonishment, this document describes
	the several skills I have acquired over the years.

                <header><h1>Music</h1></header>
	<p>Music is and has always been my number one love. I began loving music 
	since I was a todler. Even though I am a dedicated software engineer by training,
	The in-built love for music never died rather it has appreciated and is still
	appreciating. This love for music has driven me to learn and master
	how to:
	<ul>
	<li>Play the piano</li>
	<li>Play the acoustic guitar</li>
	<li>Play the bass and electric guitar</li>
	<li>Play drums</li>
	<li>Use my voice as an instrument for singing</li>
	<li>Read music</li>
	</ul>
	There so many more instrument I'll love to learn and perfect and I will do 
	that as soon as time permits me.

            <section class="main-section" id="computing">
                <header><h1>Computing</h1></header>
	<p> Computing the second love of my life. I took interest in computing way
	back when computers weren't as common as they are today. Since from
	high-school I have been fascinated by the power of the machine known as
	computer. To further this burning curiousity, I went on to learn and master how to:
	<ul>
	<li>Program in Java</li>
	<li>Program in PHP</li>
	<li>Program in Python</li>
	<li>Program in C, C# and C++</li>
	<li>Ethical Hacking</li>
	<li>Build and maintain Network Infrastructure</li>
	</ul>
	The computing field is a very vast and wide sector. New technologies keep emerging
	within short periods of time. Trying to keep up with emerging can be daunting and 
	overwhelming. However, there is nothing that can't be done with strategy,
	confidence and determination.
