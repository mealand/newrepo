	<p>It is interesting to know the great wonders of the human mind.
	So you have spent years studying and training to be a professional
	in one particular field of your choosing. Now you have graduated
	and you have been introduced into the labour market where you will
	toil and toil for at least one decade before retiring to the sumber
	anticipation of death.<br>
	Life doesn't have to be this way. You are on top of the ecosystem's
	food chain for a reason. You mind has the capacity to learn and be a
	professional at multiple fields. So you can be a:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Doctor and a Lawyer.</li>
	<li>Architect and a Programmer</li>
	<li>Musician and a Politician</li>
	<li>Footballer and a Photographer</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		<code>
	Basically the choice is yours. You can either choose to make your life
	interesting by learning new things and be a professional in multiple
	fields, or you can just follow the majority that live life in the direction
	of the wind.<br> Regarding my admonishment, this document describes
	the several skills I have acquired over the years.

	<p>Music is and has always been my number one love. I began loving music 
	since I was a todler. Even though I am a dedicated software engineer by training,
	The in-built love for music never died rather it has appreciated and is still
	appreciating. This love for music has driven me to learn and master
	how to:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Play the piano</li>
	<li>Play the acoustic guitar</li>
	<li>Play the bass and electric guitar</li>
	<li>Play drums</li>
	<li>Use my voice as an instrument for singing</li>
	<li>Read music</li>
	</ul>
	<p>

	There so many more instrument I'll love to learn and perfect and I will do 
	that as soon as time permits me.

	<p> Computing the second love of my life. I took interest in computing way
	back when computers weren't as common as they are today. Since from
	high-school I have been fascinated by the power of the machine known as
	computer. To further this burning curiousity, I went on to learn and master how to:
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Program in Java</li>
	<li>Program in PHP</li>
	<li>Program in Python</li>
	<li>Program in C, C# and C++</li>
	<li>Ethical Hacking</li>
	<li>Build and maintain Network Infrastructure</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		<code>
	The computing field is a very vast and wide sector. New technologies keep emerging
	within short periods of time. Trying to keep up with emerging can be daunting and 
	overwhelming. However, there is nothing that can't be done with strategy,
	confidence and determination.

					The arts is an intriguing and equally intoxicating venture. It is kind
					of deals wiht knowing and enjoying the science of doing things, as a result,
					I see art in everything I do even though it is widely related to things like
					drama, drawing, painting and so on. Consequently, as a hobby I indulge or 
					participate in the following arts:
				</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Painting</li>
						<li>Drawing
							<ol>
								<li>Still Life-Drawing</li>
								<li>Abstract Representation</li>
								<li>Pencil-3D Drawing</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>Drama
							<ol>
								<li>Acting</li>
								<li>Choreography</li>								
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>Poetry
							<ol>
								<li>Spoken Word</li>
								<li>Free Verse and</li>
								<li>Sonnets</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						<code>
					I most certainlly wish to devot more time to the arts because of it's cultural
					and moral significance in the society. I see myself retiring to fully face and
					completely immerse myself in the wonders of the arts.

				<p>
					This is my least favorite field. However, sciences still arouses my ever burning
					curiousity. So far I have made no gains in science, but I will very much like to
					my own fringe-like kind of lab and I will really like to do some inventions and
					have my own patents.<br>In the art of science, here are some of the things I will
					love to explore.
				</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Psychology
							<ol>
								<li>Behavioral Psychology</li>
								<li>Clinical Psychology and</li>

					I mean who doesn't want to be a "Tony Stark". Thats basically what I inspire to be in my

					This is probably the most important part of my life. That didn't come out
					well, I meant to say, I will like this(mindfulness) to be the most important
					part of my life because presently, it is at the very bottom of my to-do list.
					With that been said, these are the areas of mindfulness I'll love to explore.
